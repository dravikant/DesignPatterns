people rediscovering the same solutions over and over again. Why don't we write down those solutions as patterns? 

--> 23 patterns in the Gang of Four book.


It's easy to misunderstand patterns and think that they are prescriptive, 
that you can design the system by picking the right patterns and following them like a blueprint. 

That would be a mistake. A pattern is not a blueprint. Each pattern has many variations

How patterns are useful then?

1. Name the idea/design appraoch

2. communicate/discuss easily
